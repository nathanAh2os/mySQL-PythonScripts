# mySQL-PythonScripts

This project uses Node.js for the server, mySQL for the database, and Python (3) for the database scripts. 

We can validate data in a JSON format to insert into mySQL using our Python script. The reason I choose JSON is that it is widely used, easy to read/parse, 
and works well with many technology stacks.

Package managers include both npm and pip. 

Other libraries include pysql and Express.js (to help set up the http requests for internal webpage).
